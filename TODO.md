# 2 TODO:
The following are needed to be done:
 - [ ] Complete [stack.c](#stackc)
 - [ ] Complete [queue.c](#queuec)
 - [ ] Complete [parser.c](#parserc)
 - [ ] Fill in [infix.txt](#infixtxt) test
 - [ ] Document in GROUPNAME.PDF


# 3 Brief documentation of each file:
## 3.1 main.c
The file contains only int main() that runs the program. It should depend all other files on it.

## 3.2 stack.c
A stack is a collection of information or objects that has a "last-in, first out" (LIFO) model. This file contains a stack struct and its related functions.

## 3.3 queue.c
A queue is a collection of information organized by a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) model. This file contains a queue struct and its related functions.

## 3.4 parser.c
This file contains the parser that interpret the information from the input to the output.

## 3.5 infix.txt
It contains lines of test cases to be thrown to the program in testing using IO redirection. The result should be stored in result.txt

## 3.6 GROUPNAME.pdf
All necessary documentation is here.
